Segmented Sieve :
    Segmented Sieve is a way to generate prime numbers in a given range.

    Sieve does the same why we need Segmented Sieve?
        To generate primes upto N, we need an array of size of N in Sieve algorithm,
        but will it work if N will be as large as 10^12? No 

where is Segmented Sieve applicable?
    Segmented Sieve will work on that areas where simple Sieve might fails because L and R is so big.

    When you need to find prime numbers in range L to R where L and R can be really large
    (like 10^12) but still R - L + 1 <= 10^6

Working of Segmented Sieve :
    step 1 : Generate all prime numbers upto sqrt(R) using Sieve.
    step 2 : Create an array of size R-L+1 and set all elements to be 1(1: prime and 0:composite).
    step 3 : For each prime P in 2 to sqrt(R) :
                    for every multiple m of P in the range L to R:
                            mark index m-L as 0

Using array for range :
    e.g. Say L = 11 and R = 20 
         Then create an array of size 20-11+1 = 10
         ar = {11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}

         what is the significant of this ar?
         If number x is prime then , ar[x-L] = 1
         If number x is not prime then, ar[x-L] = 0
