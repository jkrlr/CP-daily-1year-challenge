## Stack

- **stacks** are often useful is in certain **recursive** algorithms.

  - Sometimes you need to **push** temporary data onto a **stack** as you recurse, but then **remove** them as you **backtrack** (for example, because the recursive check failed).

- A **stack** can also be used to implement a **recursive** algorithm **iteratively**.

## Queue

- **queues** are often used is in **breadth-first search** or in implementing a **cache**.

- Sometimes, **Linked List** _implementation_ of **queue** can be useful in choice based FIFO operations.

---

- Array's **circular** implementation can be useful in **space optimization** of **custom** _stack_ or _queue_ implementation.
