# Linked Lists

- when you're discussing a linked list in an **interview**, you must understand whether it is a
  **singly** linked list or a **doubly** linked list.

- The "**runner**" (or second pointer) technique is used in many linked list problems.

  - The runner technique means that you **iterate** through the linked list with **two pointers simultaneously**, with one **ahead** of the **other**.
  - The "**fast**" node might be **ahead** by a **fixed amount**, or it might be **hopping multiple nodes** for **each one node** that the "**slow**" node iterates through.

- A number of linked list problems rely on **recursion**. If you're having trouble solving a linked list problem, you should explore if a recursive approach will work.
