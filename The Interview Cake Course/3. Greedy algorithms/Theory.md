# Greedy Algorithms

- A **greedy** algorithm builds up a solution by **choosing** the option that looks the **best** at **every** step.

- **Careful**: sometimes a greedy algorithm doesn't give you an optimal solution

- **Validating** that a greedy strategy always gets the best answer is tricky.
  - Either **prove** that the answer produced by the greedy algorithm is as good as an **optimal** answer, or run through a **rigorous** set of **test cases** to convince your interviewer (and yourself) that it's correct.
