12. Pairs : Approach

Prolem Statement :
    Given an array containing N integrs, and an number S denoting a target sum.
    Find two distinct integrs that can pair up to form target sum.

This problem can be found at google mock Interview preparation quesions(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw&t=1052s)

array = [10, 5, 2, 3, -6, 9, 11] , S=4
Output = [10,-6]

(1) Brute force -> O(N^2) time

(2) Can we do better? Yes
    Which algorithm should I use to do better? Sort
    -6, 2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11
    __  __________________
    N        LogN

    NLogN (sort) + NLogN = O(NLogN)

(3) Can we still do better? Yes 
    Which Data Structure should I use to do better? Unordered_Set -> O(1) 
                                                 or Unordered_Map -> O(1) 

    => O(N) time -> we can't do better than O(N) because we have to atleast traverse the whole array.

Now, we are using unordered_set -> we have two possiblities for unordered_set :
                                   Either we can first store the all elements into the set,
                                   then compairing the one by one elements of array to the set elements for required sum pair,
                                   but in this quesions we've to find the distinct pair. So, this method is wrong.
                                   because we can get the pair of same elements satisfying the given condition. e.g. 2 + 2 = 4 but correct ans is 10 - 6 = 4

                                   or second In empty set we can start by checking the array element in set for getting the required sum,
                                   If we get the required ans then we can stop traversing,
                                   Else first we check if number is present in set or not,
                                   If it is not present in the set then we can we can store it into the set.
                    
Why we're using unordered_set because in unordered_set<...> -> we don't need to store true or false
but in case of hashmap i.e. unordered_map<key,value> we've to maintaing 
key,value pairs for storing weather a number is present or not. i.e. key,val  5 - true, -6 - true
