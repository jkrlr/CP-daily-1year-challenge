2 Coding questions + 12 Programming MCQ'safe

    1. Distinct Pairs whose sum is equal to given k
        e.g. ar = [1,2,3,4,9,7,1], k = 10 => pairs = {1,9}(and {9,1} both are same), {3,7} => ans = 2
    2. Who Wins? 
        e.g. str ="wwwbbbwww" , wincey removes adjacent w if w has adjacent w in both sides and bob removes adjacent b if b has adjacent b in both sides.
        wincey plays first move then bob and the player who can't able to play their move -> that lost the game.
            final str = "wwbbww" => wincey Wins
