=> Daimeter of the Tree

-> What is Daimeter of Tree ?
It is defined as the longest path between any 2 nodes in the tree. 

-> Novice Approach
We would run DFS, N times
In each iteration, we would set ith node as root and find farthest node.
Running Time : O(N^2)

-> Better Approach
We can find diameter in only 2 DFS run.
Take any arbitrary node as root and dfs from it and find the farthest node,
let this node be x.
Run a dfs from node x and find the maximum distance from this node to any other node,
this diameter is diameter.
