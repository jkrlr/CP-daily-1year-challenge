Articulation Points : 
        An articulation point(or Cut vertex) is a vertex which when removed
        makes graph disconnected Or more precisely it increases the no. of connected components.

Conclusion :
    1. End-points of a bridge will be articulation point if that node has degree at least 2.
    2. It is not necessary for an articulation point to be end point of bridge.
    3. Finding bridges algorithm can not be used for find articulation point.
